        <p>
            In Nova Games, we publish games on itch.io, an Indie Developer program where people can publish their own games and have people play them!
            We recently published our own game called Beyond Eldorado Forest. it is based on a place in Greece called Eldorado. This is our first game
            and more games will come out! The game was released on the 4th of April 2023.

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Nova Games (Made by 2 Year 7/graders) is a company for indie games in Britain. We are a child-friendly place where anyone can play our games and try them out. We are still in our
                early development stage where we are beginning to start work but not everythings on the list is checked yet. The name of our company (Nova Games) was created by our Head Developer
                Nemesis. All games and websites were coded by SpicyWater. Our developer who just joined the Nova Team, Joey, is in America. Although he is not active as much as SpicyWater and 
                Nemesis, he gives us some ideas. This is all we can say as of our bio because we have just started. Welcome to Nova.<br><br>
